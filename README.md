# Division Inspired TPS

After playing Tom Clancy's The Division (1 & 2), I was inspired to create a third-person shooter. Although I didn't have a specific game concept in mind, I took the liberty of developing a simple third-person shooter controller. The controller showcased here utilizes a combination of excellent root motion animations and Unity's animation rigging package for Inverse Kinematics.
